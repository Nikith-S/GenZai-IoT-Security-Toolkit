<h2> Setup and Usage </h2>
<h3> Setup </h3>
The tool is written in Go, so make sure to <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">install</a> it on your system before proceeding. The setup is pretty easy and straight forward. Just follow the below steps in order to quickly install and get the binary working.
<br>
<br>
Firstly clone the repo to any directory/path of your liking,<br><br>

```
git clone https://github.com/umair9747/Genzai.git
```
Afer this, just run the following command in order to build the binary according to your environment.

```
go build
```

<h3> Usage </h3>

<h4>1. Basic Usage</h4>
In order to get started with Genzai and run it straightaway, you just need to provide your target(s) as input to the tool. This can be mainly done in the following ways,

<br><br>
To run it against a single target,

```
./genzai http://1.1.1.1/
```
To run it against multiple targets passed directly through CLI,

```
./genzai http://1.1.1.1/ http://8.8.8.8/
```
To run it against multiple targets passed through an input file,

```
./genzai targets.txt
```

<h4>2. Output</h4>
If you'd like to log the output from Genzai in some file, you have the <b>-save</b> flag to the rescue! The flag will log the output in a file named output.json by default if no additional value is provided along with the flag.

<br><br>
So, in order to log the output in a specific file name, you will use,

```
./genzai http://1.1.1.1 -save myfile.json
```

And with the below example, it will be saved to output.json by default.
```
./genzai http://1.1.1.1 -save
```

<br><br>
Let's also discuss about the format of output that Genzai returns. It will be in the below format:

<br>

```
{
  "Response": {
    "Results": [
      {
        "Target": "",
        "IoTidentified": "",
        "category": "",
        "Issues": [
          {
            "IssueTitle": "",
            "URL": "",
            "AdditionalContext": ""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Targets": []
  }
}

```
The results array contains the entries for all the IoT related assets that were successfully identified and scanned. Target field contains the URL of the asset, IoTidentified contains the product name, category contains the exact category the IoT product belongs to, Issues array will be populated with all the issues identified with the asset such as any potential vulnerabilities and default password issues.<br>
Finally, the Targets array contains the list of all targets that were scanned using the tool irrespective of them being identified as an IoT asset or not.


The below example output would hopefully give you a glimpse of the format,

<br>

```
./genzai http://1.1.1.1/
