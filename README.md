<h2> Description </h2>
Genzai helps you identify IoT or Internet of Things related dashboards across a single or set of targets provided as an input and furthermore scan them for default password issues and potential vulnerabilities based on paths and versions.
<br></br>
An example would be an admin panel for a home automation device acceessible over the internet. The tool will firstly fingerprint the IoT (product) based on a set of signatures from <a href="./signatures.json">signatures.json</a> and then based on the product identified, and the relevant templates in its DBs (<a href="./vendor-logins.json">vendor-logins.json</a> and <a href="./vendor-vulns.json">vendor-vulns.json</a>), scan it for vendor-specific default passwords like  admin:admin as well as look for any potential vulnerabilities.
<br><br>
Genzai currently supports fingerprinting over 20 IoT-based dashboards and has the same amount of templates to look for default password issues across them. It currently has a total of 10 vulnerability templates which will increase with coming updates.

<h2> Features </h2>

<h4>Fingerprinting - The Wappalyzer of IoT Devices</h4>
With Genzai, you can fingerprint the IoT Product running over a target based on the HTTP response received through it. With a support of 20 templates and counting, Genzai can look for categories such as:
<br>

- Wireless Router
- Surveillance Camera
- HMI or Human Machine Interface
- Smart Power Control
- Building Access Control System
- Climate Control
- Industrial Automation
- Home Automation
- Water Treatment System

<h4>Default Password Checks</h4>
Based on the IoT product identified and the presence of a relevant template in <a href="./vendor-logins.json">Vendor Logins DB</a>, Genzai will also check if the target is still using a vendor-specific default password considering how several devices across the internet still use a default password letting anyone to log in as an administrative user.

<h4>Vulnerability Scanning</h4>
Also based on the IoT product identified and with the presence of a relevant template in <a href="./vendor-vulns.json">Vendor Vulns DB</a>, Genzai will check for any potential vulnerabilities across the target. While some of the templates actively flag issues based on an exposed endpoint or file, others may flag based on a vulnerable version.
